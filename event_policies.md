# GoBridge Event Policies

## About
Online and Offline communities include people from many different backgrounds. The Go contributors are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or similar personal characteristics.

We will be using the GoBridge Code of Conduct (CoC) as our base document for our standards and resolution procedures. In the spirit of being transparent, we will list our goals, values and expectations. We will also make it clear what you can expect from the organizers.

## Goals
The first goal of the CoC is to specify a baseline standard of behavior so that people with different social values and communication styles can talk about Go effectively, productively, and respectfully. 

The second goal is to provide a mechanism for resolving conflicts in the community when they arise.

The third goal of the CoC is to make our community welcoming to people from different backgrounds. Diversity is critical to the project; for Go to be successful, it needs contributors and users from all backgrounds.

We believe that healthy debate and disagreement are essential to a healthy project and community. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful. We value diverse opinions, but we value respectful behavior more.

## Gopher Values
These are the values to which people in the Go community (“Gophers”) should aspire.

* Be friendly and welcoming
* Be patient
    * Remember that people have varying communication styles and not everyone is using their native language. (Meaning and tone can be lost in translation.)
* Be thoughtful
    * Productive communication requires effort. Think about how your words will be interpreted.
    * Remember that sometimes it is best to refrain entirely from commenting.
* Be respectful
    * In particular, respect differences of opinion.
* Be charitable
    * Interpret the arguments of others in good faith, do not seek to disagree.
    * When we do disagree, try to understand why.
* Avoid destructive behavior
    * Derailing: stay on topic; if you want to talk about something else, start a new conversation.
    * Unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.
    * Snarking (pithy, unproductive, sniping comments)
    * Discussing potentially offensive or sensitive issues; this all too often leads to unnecessary conflict.
    * Microaggressions: brief and commonplace verbal, behavioral and environmental indignities that communicate hostile, derogatory or negative slights and insults to a person or group.
    * People are complicated. You should expect to be misunderstood and to misunderstand others; when this inevitably occurs, resist the urge to be defensive or assign blame. Try not to take offense where no offense was intended. Give people the benefit of the doubt. Even if the intent was to provoke, do not rise to it. It is the responsibility of all parties to de-escalate conflict when it arises.

## Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, native language, operating system choice or prior experience.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Using unwelcoming and exclusive language
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities
Organizers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. Organizers have the right and responsibility to correct behavior or remove anyone from the conference who violates the CoC.

## Conflict Resolution
We do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement often yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or to engage in behavior that violates the CoC.

If you see someone violating the CoC, you are encouraged to address the behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, report it to an organizer immediately. We are dedicated to providing an environment where participants feel welcome and safe.

Reports should be directed to [NAME] or any organizer who will be easily identifiable during the conference. It’s [NAME]’s duty to receive and address reported violations of the CoC. [FIRST NAME] will work with the other organizers to identify a reasonable outcome to keep the conference welcoming and safe. If for any reason you feel the conference organizers have not lived up to their promise, please email the Go language CoC committee at conduct@golang.org.

## Summary

* Treat everyone with respect and kindness
* Be thoughtful in how you communicate
* Don’t be destructive or inflammatory
* If you encounter an issue, contact an organizer or email [EMAIL FOR EVENT]
